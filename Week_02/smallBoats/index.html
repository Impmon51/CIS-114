		<p>The Skiff is a beautiful small boat! The Skiff has a pointed bow, and a flat bottom.
		They can either be powered, with a small crew — usually of one or two —  by oars, or with a sail.
		They tend to be anywhere between 12 ft and 18 ft in length. Traditionally, these are wooden boats,
		but in the modern age, you do see fiberglass vessels. They can be used in just about any body of
		water, from lakes, to rivers, to ocean. Due to the small crew, they are excellent ships for fishing
		and doing other water based work or activity!</p>			<!-- Paragraph -->
