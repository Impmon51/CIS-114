		<p>The Skiff is a beautiful small boat! The Skiff has a pointed bow, and a flat bottom. 
		They can either be powered — with a small crew of usually one or two —  by oars, or with a sail. <br>
		They tend to be anywhere between 12 ft and 18 ft in length. Traditionally, these are wooden boats, 
		but in the modern age, you do see fiberglass vessels. They can be used in just about any body of <br>
		water, from lakes, to rivers, to ocean. Due to the small crew, they are excellent ships for fishing 
		and doing other water based work or activity!</p>			<!-- Paragraph -->

		<p>One interesting fun fact about the Skiff is that it was mentioned & 
		featured in the literary classic, <em>"Moby-Dick"</em>.</p>	<!-- Paragraph -->
