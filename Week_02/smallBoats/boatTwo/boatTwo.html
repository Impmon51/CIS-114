		<p>The Sloop is another beautiful example of a small boat! The Sloop also has a pointed bow and 
		a single mast, with one headsail in front of the mast and one mainsail behind it. It’s larger <br></br>
		than the Skiff, they can easily get to be twice the length, at anywhere between 12 ft, to 50 ft 
		in length. Due to the larger size, much more crew is required. Traditional Sloops are also made of <br></br>
		wood, but you can find some out of fiberglass too. Typically Sloops are sea vessels, very good for 
		shipping, but also leisure!</p>								<!-- Paragraph -->
