		<p>The Sloop is another beautiful example of a small boat! The Sloop also has a pointed bow. It also has 
		a single mast, with one headsail in front of the mast, and one mainsail behind it. <br>
		It’s larger than the Skiff, they can easily get to be twice the length, at anywhere between 12 ft,
		to 50 ft in length. Due to the larger size, much more crew is required. Traditional Sloops <br>
		are also made of wood, but you can find some out of fiberglass too. Typically Sloops are sea vessels, 
		very good for shipping, but also leisure!</p>								<!-- Paragraph -->

		<p>Skiffs were often used as Merchant ships in the 1600s, but many were
		converted into <strong>Pirate</strong> ships!</p>			<!-- Paragraph -->
